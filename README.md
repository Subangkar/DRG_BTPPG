# Samsung Gear Fit 2 Pro Sensor Data Logger  
This app is a single view native UI application generated by [Tizen UI builder](https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-studio/native-tools/writing-and-editing-code/ui-builder). After installation, you will see an icon named "DRG BTPPG" in your app list.
This native app starts/stops a [background service](https://github.com/Subangkar/Tizen-Sensor-Raw-Data-Saving-Service) which collects sensor data.
